                                    <h2>How to install dbt locally on Windows</h2>
                                    <p>The way that data models are transformed has been revolutionized over the past few years and a tool that has been at the forefront of this change is 
                                        <b>dbt</b> (data build tool). There are currently a handful of guides on how to install this tool, however most of them lack the necessary depth to 
                                        cover all aspects of the process, making it hard for people who are new in data to follow. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>This article aims to walk you through each single step of successfully installing this tool in your virtual environment and will build upon 
                                            <a href='https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core'> dbt core's installation guide</a>. There are multiple adapters 
                                            available depending on the data warehouse that you use, however we will leverage <b>PostgreSQL</b>, a free and open source relational database management system <b>(RDBMS)</b>,
                                            which you will install in your local machine. Therefore, you can create and work on your own small database without the need to create any cloud account. 
                                            This could be especially useful for people who just want to get hands-on experience with dbt and are in their first steps of their data journey or for those who want to further 
                                            practice their data modelling skills.</p>

                                        <h2>Install Postgres</h2>
                                        <p>In this example we will download and use postgres locally, one of the most widely used RDBMS. Firstly, download 
                                            <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/download/'><u>postgres</u></a>. Choose your operating system and once the download is complete proceed by installing it. 
                                            Create your credentials and I would also strongly recommend downloading a GUI such as <a href="https://dbeaver.io/"> <u>DBeaver</u>
                                            </a>to execute your queries.</p>

                                        <h2>Install Python and PIP</h2>
                                        <p>The next step is to install Python and PIP. Before proceeding, check which are dbt-core's current compatible Python versions on dbt's 
                                            <a href='https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/core/install-python-compatibility'> <u>website</u></a>. Then head to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download 
                                            the latest compatible Python version. Once the installation starts, make sure to select add python to PATH as well as to environment variables.</p>

                                        <h2>Install dbt </h2>
                                        <p>The last thing to be installed is dbt and specifically the postgres adapter. Execute the following command in your terminal:<br /><br />
                                        <code>$ pip install dbt-postgres</code><br /><br />
                                            Installing dbt will take a couple of minutes. Once the installation is complete, make sure that it has been installed correctly by running the following command, 
                                            which will print out the dbt version in your local machine. <br /><br />
                                        <code>$ dbt --version</code></p>
                                        
                                        <h2>Configuring dbt </h2>
                                        <p>A new folder, <i>.dbt</i>, should have been created outside of the dbt project containing a <i>profiles.yml</i> file. Dbt uses profiles to connect to the database, therefore
                                        it is of the utmost importance to configure it with the correct credentials. Open the file and update each respective field and use the credentials used
                                        when setting up PostgreSQL. </p>
                                            <figure>
                                                <img src="images/profiles.png" width=260 height=320>
                                              </figure>
                                            <figcaption><b>dbt profiles.yml example</b></figcaption>
                                        <p> 
                                        
                                        </p>
                                        To ensure that a connection can be established, execute the following command in the terminal:</div>
                                        <code>$ dbt debug</code></p>
                                        If the configuration was set up correctly, executing the dbt debug command should return something like this:
                                        <figure>
                                            <img src="images/dbt_debug.png" width=480 height=320>
                                          </figure>
                                    </header>
                                    With dbt set up, you can start creating your own data models! In case you are looking for datasets to download and practice both your PostgreSQL
                                    and data modelling skills, I would recommend downloading the <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/download/'><u>jaffle shop</u></a> repository,
                                      which contains raw data that you can use to get started with dbt!</br> </br>

                                    <h2>Final Words </h2>
                                    This article shows how to install and configure dbt locally, by installing the postgres adapter via pip. Happy data modelling!
